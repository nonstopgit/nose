# Installation wizard for October

The wizard installation is the recommended way to install October for **non-technical users**. It is simpler than the command-line installation and doesn't require any special skills.

> **Note:** If you are a developer, we recommend that you install via Composer instead: https://octobercms.com/docs/console/commands#console-install-composer

1. Prepare a directory on your server that is empty. It can be a sub-directory, domain root or a sub-domain.
1. [Download the installer archive file](https://github.com/octobercms/install/archive/master.zip).
1. Unpack the installer archive to the prepared directory.
1. Grant writing permissions on the installation directory and all its subdirectories and files.
1. Navigate to the install.php script in your web browser.
1. Follow the installation instructions.

## Minimum System Requirements

October CMS has a few system requirements:

* PHP version 7.2 or higher
* PDO PHP Extension (and relevant driver for the database you want to connect to)
* cURL PHP Extension
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* ZipArchive PHP Extension
